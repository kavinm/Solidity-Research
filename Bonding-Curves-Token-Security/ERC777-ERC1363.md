## Problems ERC777 Solves

ERC777 was created as a token standard to fix issues and add functionality to ERC20. It is backwards compatible with ERC20.

#### Approve and Pull Flow

One of the main issues with ERC20 is the approve and transfer flow for sending tokens.
To swap an ERC20 on Uniswap, you must first approve a spending limit, usually arbitrarily high for the Uniswap contract in one tx. In the next tx, the transfer actually takes place.
ERC777 fixes this issue by introducing hooks.
